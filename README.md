# SANSNewtoCyberSurvey
The basic findings/results of my survey done via SurveyMonkey for the SANS New to Cyber 2021 Summit

Some context to the audience who responded to survey
- Advertised via Twitter/Linkedin personal networks
- Asked for (and recieved) amplification from Splunk Employees and folks related to SANS
- I used SurveyMonkey options with a few additions for the questions around Country, Gender, Industry and Education
   - I added Taiwan for Country
   - I added a few options for industry

Some info on the files:
- New_to_Cyber.csv is unedited except for addtion of a single field.
- CertValue.csv and job_roles.csv both have slight modifications to make it easier to bucketize

510 responses as of this date. You can also find the results on SurveyMonkey: https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-WBMYQN9L9/
